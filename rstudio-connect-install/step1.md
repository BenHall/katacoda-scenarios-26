First let's download the install script: `curl -LO https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-connect/rsc-installer.sh`{{execute}}

Next, let's install the pre-release version of RStudio Connect that contains the setup tool: `bash rsc-installer.sh install -y 1.7.9-5306`{{execute}}

Once the installation has finished you will be greeted with a message similar to the following:
`RStudio Connect Setup is starting.  To use it, open the URL,
http://ip-10-0-1-89:13939/setup/start?token=8e466f6127a88b01
in a browser that can reach this computer (note that the server name may need
to be different). The web app will walk you through the entire setup process.`
